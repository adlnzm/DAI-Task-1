# Sales Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

## Dataset
- **Rows:** 33,919
- **Columns:** 13
- **Purpose:** This dataset seems to be the **raw export** or unprocessed version.
- **Issues Identified:**
  - Contains **5 unnamed columns** (`Unnamed: 8` to `Unnamed: 12`) with mostly null values.
  - Mixed formatting in column names (e.g., `Order Number`, `SKU ID`, etc.).
  - No computed fields like averages or max metrics.
  - Some columns like `Order Quantity` are floats, possibly due to inconsistent data entry.

## Code

The script processes the **Sales Data** from a multi-sheet Excel workbook and performs feature engineering to analyze average and maximum sales per day. Below is a breakdown of the steps:

1. Importing Required Libraries
```python
import pandas as pd
```
We use Pandas for data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.

2. Load Sales Data from Excel
```python
df_sales = pd.read_excel('/Users/adlnzmnzr/Downloads/Dynamic Inventory Analytics.xlsx', sheet_name='Sales Data')
```
Loads the "Sales Data" sheet from the Excel file into a Pandas DataFrame.

3. Check for Missing Values
```python
df_sales.isnull()
```
Identifies missing values within the dataset (though this does not modify the data).

4. Drop Unnecessary Columns
```python
df_sales.drop(['Unnamed: 8', 'Unnamed: 9', 'Unnamed: 10', 'Unnamed: 11', 'Unnamed: 12'], axis=1, inplace=True)
```
Removes unused or empty columns that may have been auto-generated by Excel.

5. Data Type Conversion
```python
df_sales['Order Quantity'] = df_sales['Order Quantity'].astype(int)
df_sales['Order Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df_sales['Order Date'])
```
- Converts the `Order Quantity` column to integer type for accurate numerical operations.
- Parses the `Order Date` column to datetime format to support time-based analysis.

6. Identify Unique SKUs
```python
df_sales['sku_id'].drop_duplicates()
```
Displays unique product SKUs from the dataset.

7. Feature Engineering - Sales Insights
```python
df_sales['avg_sales_per_day'] = df_sales.groupby(['sku_id', 'warehouse_id', 'order_date'])['order_quantity'].transform('mean')
df_sales['max_sales_per_day'] = df_sales.groupby(['sku_id', 'warehouse_id', 'order_date'])['order_quantity'].transform('max')
```
- `avg_sales_per_day`: Computes the average daily sales per SKU per warehouse.
- `max_sales_per_day`: Computes the maximum daily sales per SKU per warehouse.

These engineered features can be used for demand forecasting, stock optimization, or further analysis.

## Clean Dataset
- **Rows:** 33,919
- **Columns:** 10
- **Purpose:** This dataset appears to be the **cleaned and processed** version of the raw sales data.
- **Clean Features:**
  - Proper column names (e.g., `order_date`, `sku_id`, etc. in lowercase and with underscores).
  - No extra or unnamed columns.
  - All data types are correct and consistent.
- **Additional Metrics Added:**
  - `avg_sales_per_day`
  - `max_sales_per_day`

These are **calculated metrics** not found in the raw dataset, likely derived during data cleaning/analysis.
